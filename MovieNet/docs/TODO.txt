-Load initial data using fixtures - DONE


Home Page
	-Should be login page? What else would it be? A generic introductory welcome to the site?
Registration
	-need to add DOB and Sex fields in addition to those needed by django auth
	-take away member table and use the User table id as foreign key in Rated table
Login
	-Redirects to User Profile Page
User Profile
	-Will contain user information along with information on movies that have been rated
	-Could possibly have "starred" movies that the user likes
Find
	-Movies
	-Actor
	-Director
Add Movie
	-Will ask to provide IMDB url
	-Will redirect back to Home Page or Add Movie screen
Movie Page, also Actor and Director Pages
	-There should be some widget to rate a movie
		-If in time crunch can have a form on a separate page that will redirect to movie page when done
		-Look at jquery plugins
	-If a user is logged in and has rated a movie, then the rating should be displayed
	

VIEWS and URLs: 
	-For registration and login could use class-based views. Same goes for results of the Find page
		-'/register'
		-'/login' (Home page: so '^$' should link to this)
		-'/logout
			-This will obviously redirect to something else
	-For movie, actor, and director, will have a view that takes an ID as an argument
		-'/movie/(id)'
		-'/actor/(id)'
		-'/director/(id)'
	-For queries, it may be possible to utilize class-based views (possibly DetailedView with a given querySet?)
		-'/find/(movie|actor|director)'
			-May provide query parameters since this will be a HTTP GET
	-For adding movies, will link to a view that will do the imdb parsing
		-'/add'
			-IMDB URL should be passed as POST parameter
	-For the user profile part, may be able to utilize class-based views. Not sure
		-'/user/(id)'
		-'/user' should link to a view that displays the top users for the month
